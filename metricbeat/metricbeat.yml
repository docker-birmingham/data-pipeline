########################## Metricbeat Configuration ###########################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see metricbeat-host.yml in the same directory.

# You can find the full configuration reference here:

#============================  Config Reloading ===============================

# Config reloading allows to dynamically load modules. Each file which is
# monitored must contain one or multiple modules as a list.
metricbeat.config.modules:

  # Glob pattern for configuration reloading
  path: ${path.config}/conf.d/*.yml

  # Period on which files under path should be checked for changes
  reload.period: 10s

  # Set to true to enable config reloading
  reload.enabled: false

# Maximum amount of time to randomly delay the start of a metricset. Use 0 to
# disable startup delay.
metricbeat.max_start_delay: 10s

#==========================  Modules configuration ============================
metricbeat.modules:

#------------------------------- Docker Module -------------------------------
- module: docker
  metricsets: ["container", "cpu", "diskio", "healthcheck", "info", "memory", "network"]
  hosts: ["unix:///var/run/docker.sock"]
  period: 10s

#------------------------------- System Module -------------------------------
- module: system
  metricsets:
    - cpu             # CPU usage
    - filesystem      # File system usage for each mountpoint
    - fsstat          # File system summary metrics
    - load            # CPU load averages
    - memory          # Memory usage
    - network         # Network IO
    - process         # Per process metrics
    - process_summary # Process summary
    - core           # Per CPU core usage
    - diskio         # Disk IO
    - socket         # Sockets and connection info (linux only)
  enabled: true
  period: 5s
  processes: ['.*']

  # Configure the metric types that are included by these metricsets.
  cpu.metrics:  ["percentages", "normalized_percentages"]  # The other available options are normalized_percentages and ticks.
  core.metrics: ["percentages"]  # The other available option is ticks.

#================================ General ======================================

# The name of the shipper that publishes the network data. It can be used to group
# all the transactions sent by a single shipper in the web interface.
# If this options is not defined, the hostname is used.
name: host

# Internal queue configuration for buffering events to be published.
queue:
  # Queue type by name (default 'mem')
  # The memory queue will present all available events (up to the outputs
  # bulk_max_size) to the output, the moment the output is ready to server
  # another batch of events.
  mem:
    # Max number of events the queue can buffer.
    events: 4096

    # Hints the minimum number of events stored in the queue,
    # before providing a batch of events to the outputs.
    # A value of 0 (the default) ensures events are immediately available
    # to be sent to the outputs.
    flush.min_events: 2048

    # Maximum duration after which events are available to the outputs,
    # if the number of events stored in the queue is < min_flush_events.
    flush.timeout: 1s

#================================ Outputs ======================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#output.logstash:
#  hosts: ["logstash:5044"]

output.kafka:
  # initial brokers for reading cluster metadata
  hosts: ["kafka:9092"]

  # message topic selection + partitioning
  topic: messages
  partition.round_robin:
    reachable_only: false

  required_acks: 1
  compression: gzip
  max_message_bytes: 1000000

#============================== Template =====================================

# A template is used to set the mapping in Elasticsearch
# By default template loading is enabled and the template is loaded.
# These settings can be adjusted to load your own template or overwrite existing ones.

# Elasticsearch template settings
setup.template.settings:

  index.number_of_shards: 1
  index.number_of_replicas: 1

#================================ Logging ======================================
# There are three options for the log output: syslog, file, stderr.
# Under Windows systems, the log files are per default sent to the file output,
# under all other system per default to syslog.

# Logging to rotating files files. Set logging.to_files to false to disable logging to
# files.
